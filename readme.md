# Calculator Extension for Chrome

A highly capable calculator extension for Chrome. This calculator focuses on providing an ideal experience for quick multi-step calculations with the history display taking center stage, and input handled by the user's keyboard rather than on-screen controls that waste space.

Powered by Math.js (https://mathjs.org/) this calculator supports a wide range of mathematical functions, algebra simplification, persistent variables, and much more.

Inspired by "Cloudy Calculator."
